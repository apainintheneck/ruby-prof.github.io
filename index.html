        <h2><a id="overview">Overview</a></h2>
        <p>ruby-prof is a code profiler for MRI Ruby. Its features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Speed - it is a C extension and therefore many times faster than
              the standard Ruby profiler.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Modes - ruby-prof can measure program wall time, process time,
              object allocations and memory usage</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Reports - ruby-prof can generate text and cross-referenced html
              reports</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Flat Profiles - similar to the reports generated by the
                  standard Ruby profiler</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Graph profiles - similar to GProf, these show how long a
                  method runs, which methods call it and which methods it calls.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Call tree profiles - outputs results in the calltree format
                  suitable for the KCacheGrind profiling tool.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Many more – see reports section of this README.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Threads - supports profiling multiple threads simultaneously</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a id="why-ruby-prof">Why ruby-prof?</a></h2>
        <p>ruby-prof if helpful if your program is slow and you don't know why.
          It will help you track down methods that are either slow, allocate a
          number of objects or allocate objects with high memory usage. Often
          times the results will be surprising - when profiling what you think
          you know almost always turns out to be wrong.</p>
        <p>Because ruby-prof is built using ruby's C <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.1/TracePoint.html">tracepoint
            </a>api, it knows a lot about your program. However, using ruby-prof
          also comes with two caveats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>To use ruby-prof you generally need to include a few lines of
              extra code in your program (although see <a href="#command-line"
                title="Command Line"> command line usage</a>)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Using ruby-prof will cause your program to run slower (see <a href="#performance">
                Performance </a>section) </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of the time, these two caveats are acceptable. But if you need
          to determine why a program running in production is slow or hung, a
          sampling profiler will be a better choice. Excellent choices include <a
            href="https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof">stackprof </a>or <a href="https://rbspy.github.io/">rbspy</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are just interested in memory usage, you may also want to
          checkout the <a href="https://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler">memory_profiler</a>
          gem (although ruby-prof provides similar information).</p>
        <h2><a id="installation">Installation</a></h2>
        <p>The easiest way to install ruby-prof is by using Ruby Gems. To
          install:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">gem</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">install</span> <span
class="ruby-identifier">ruby</span><span class="ruby-operator">-</span><span class="ruby-identifier">prof</span>
</pre> If you are running Linux or Unix you'll need to have a C compiler so the
        extension can be compiled when it is installed. If you are running
        Windows, then you should install the Windows specific RubyGem which
        includes an already built extension or install <br>
        <p>install <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit.html">devkit</a>.</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>ruby-prof requires Ruby 2.4.0 or higher.</p>
        <h2><a id="getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
        <p>There are three ways to use ruby-prof:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>command line</li>
          <li>convenience API</li>
          <li>core API</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="command-line">Command Line </a></h3>
        <p>The easiest way to use ruby-prof is via the command line, which
          requires no modifications to your program.&nbsp; To first is to use
          ruby-prof to run the Ruby program you want to profile. The basic usage
          is:</p>
        <pre>ruby-prof [options] &lt;script.rb&gt; [--] [script-options]<span style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">"</span></pre>
        <p> Where script.rb is the program you want to profile.</p>
        <p>For a full list of options, see the <a href="#profiling-options">Profiling
            Options</a> section below or execute the following command:</p>
        <pre>ruby-prof -h</pre>
        <h3>Convenience API<span></span></h3>
        <p>The second way to use ruby-prof is via its convenience API. This
          requires small modifications to the program you want to profile:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">start</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">stop</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># print a flat profile to text</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span
class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">FlatPrinter</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span>)
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">print</span>(<span
class="ruby-constant">STDOUT</span>)
</pre>
        <p>Alternatively, you can use a block to tell ruby-prof what to profile:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">profile</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># print a graph profile to text</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span
class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">GraphPrinter</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span>)
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">print</span>(<span
class="ruby-constant">STDOUT</span>, {})
</pre> ruby-prof also supports pausing and resuming profiling runs.
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-comment"># profile the code</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">start</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>

<span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">pause</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... other code ...</span>

<span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">resume</span>
<span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile ...</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">stop</span>
</pre>
        <p>Note that resume will only work if start has been called previously.
          In addition, resume can also take a block:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>

<span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">resume</span> <span
class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment"># ... code to profile...</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">stop</span>
</pre>
        <p>With this usage, resume will automatically call pause at the end of
          the block.</p>
        <p>The RubyProf.profile method can take various options, which are
          described in the <a href="#profiling-options">Profiling Options</a>
          below. </p>
        <h3>Core API</h3>
        <p>The convenience API is a wrapper around the the Ruby::Profile class.
          Using the Profile class directly provides addition functionality, such
          as <a href="#method-exclusion">method exclusion</a>.</p>
        <p>To create a new profile:</p>
        <pre>require 'ruby-prof'

profile = RubyProf::Profile.new(options)
result = profile.profile do
           ...
         end</pre>
        Once a profile is completed, you can either generate a <a href="#reports">report
          </a>via a printer or <a href="#saving-results">save </a>the results
        for later analysis. For a list of profiling options, please see the <a
          href="#profiling-options">Profiling Options</a> section.

        <h3><a id="measurements">Measurement Mode<br <="" a="">
          </a></h3>
        <a id="measurements">
          <p>Depending on the mode and platform, ruby-prof can measure various
            aspects of a Ruby program. Supported measurements include:</p>
          <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">
            <dt>RubyProf::WALL_TIME</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Wall time measures the real-world time elapsed between any two
                moments. If there are other processes concurrently running on
                the system that use significant CPU or disk time during a
                profiling run then the reported results will be larger than
                expected. On Windows, wall time is measured using
                GetTickCount(), on MacOS by mach_absolute_time and on Linux and
                other Unix variants by clock_gettime.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>RubyProf::PROCESS_TIME</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Process time measures the time used by a process between any
                two moments. It is unaffected by other processes concurrently
                running on the system. Remember with process time that calls to
                methods like sleep will not be included in profiling results. On
                Windows, process time is measured using GetProcessTimes and on
                other platforms clock_gettime is used.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>RubyProf::ALLOCATIONS</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Object allocation reports show how many objects each method in
                a program allocates.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>RubyProf::MEMORY</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Memory usage reports show how much memory each method in a
                program uses.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>To set the measurement mode:</p>
          <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">measure_mode</span> = <span
class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span
class="ruby-constant">WALL_TIME</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">measure_mode</span> = <span

class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span
class="ruby-constant">MEMORY</span>
</pre>
          <p>The default value is <code>RubyProf::WALL_TIME</code>. You may
            also specify the measure mode by using the <code>RUBY_PROF_MEASURE_MODE</code>
            environment variable: </p>
          <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">export</span> <span class="ruby-constant">RUBY_PROF_MEASURE_MODE</span>=<span
class="ruby-identifier">wall</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">export</span> <span class="ruby-constant">RUBY_PROF_MEASURE_MODE</span>=<span

<span class="ruby-identifier">export</span> <span class="ruby-constant">RUBY_PROF_MEASURE_MODE</span>=<span
class="ruby-identifier">memory</span>
</pre> </a>
        <h3><a id="allocation-tracking">Allocation Tracking</a></h3>
        <p>ruby-prof has the ability to track object allocations. This
          functionality can be turned on via the track_allocations option:</p>
        <pre>require 'ruby-prof'

RubyProf.profile(:track_allocations =&gt; true) do
  ...
end</pre>
        <p>Note the RubyProf::ALLOCATTIONS measure mode is slightly different
          than tracking allocations. The measurement mode provides high level
          information about the number of allocations performed in each method.
          In contrast, tracking allocations provides detailed information about
          the type, number, memory usage and location of each allocation.
          Currently, to see allocations results you must use the
          RubyProf::GraphHtmlPrinter.</p>
        <a>
          <h3>Thread Inclusion/Exclusion</h3>
          <p>ruby-prof can profile multiple simultaneous threads. Sometimes this
            can be overwhelming. For example, say you want to deterimne why your
            tests are running slowly.&nbsp; If you are using minitest, it will
            run your tests in parallel by spawning tens of worker threads (note
            to tell minitest to use a single thread set the N environmental
            variable like this ENV = “0”). Thus, ruby-prof provides two options
            to specify which threads should be profiled:</p>
          <pre>exclude_threads::
    Array of threads which should not be profiled.

include_threads::
    Array of threads which should be profiled. All other threads will
    be ignored.</pre>
        </a>
        <h3><a id="method-exclusion">Method Exclusion</a></h3>
        <p>ruby-prof supports excluding specific methods and threads from
          profiling results. This is useful for reducing connectivity in the
          call graph, making it easier to identify the source of performance
          problems when using a graph printer. For example, consider <code>Integer#times</code>:
          it's hardly ever useful to know how much time is spent in the method
          itself. We are more interested in how much the passed in block
          contributes to the time spent in the method which contains the <code>Integer#times</code>
          call. The effect on collected metrics are identical to eliminating
          methods from the profiling result in a post process step.</p>
        <pre>profile = RubyProf::Profile.new(...)
profile.exclude_methods!(Integer, :times, ...)
profile.start</pre>
        <p>A convenience method is provided to exclude a large number of methods
          which usually clutter up profiles:</p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">profile</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">exclude_common_methods!</span>
</pre>
        <p>However, this is a somewhat opinionated method collection. It's
          usually better to view it as an inspiration instead of using it
          directly (see <a href="https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/blob/e087b7d7ca11eecf1717d95a5c5fea1e36ea3136/lib/ruby-prof/profile/exclude_common_methods.rb">github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/blob/e087b7d7ca11eecf1717d95a5c5fea1e36ea3136/lib/ruby-prof/profile/exclude_common_methods.rb</a>).
          </p>
        <h3><a id="saving-results">Saving Results</a></h3>
        <p>It can be helpful to save the results of a profiling run for later
          analysis.&nbsp; Profiling results can be saved using Ruby's <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Marshal.html">marshal
            </a>library.</p>
        <pre>profile_1 = RubyProf.profile do

class="ruby-constant">STDOUT</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:min_percent</span> <span
class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">2</span>)
</pre>
        <p>The first parameter is any writable IO object such as <code>STDOUT</code>
          or a file. The second parameter specifies the minimum percentage a
          method must take to be printed. Percentages should be specified as
          integers in the range 0 to 100. For more information please see the
          documentation for the different printers.</p>
        <p>The different types of reports, and their associated printers, are:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Flat Reports (RubyProf::FlatPrinter and
            RubyProf::FlatPrinterWithLineNumbers)</dt>
          <dd>Flat reports show the overall time spent in each method. They are
            a good way of quickly identifying which methods take the most time.
            An example of a flat profile and an explanation can be found in <a
              href="./examples/flat.txt">examples/flat.txt</a>. </dd>
          <dt>Graph Reports (RubyProf::GraphPrinter)</dt>
          <dd>Graph reports also show the overall time spent in each method. In
            addition, they also show which methods call the current method and
            which methods its calls. Thus they are good for understanding how
            methods gets called and provide insight into the flow of your
            program. An example text graph profile is located at <a href="./examples/graph.txt">examples/graph.txt</a>.
            <br>
          </dd>
          <dt>HTML Graph Reports (RubyProf::GraphHtmlPrinter)</dt>
          <dd>HTML Graph profiles are the same as graph reports, except output
            is generated in hyper-linked HTML. Since graph reports can be quite
            large, the embedded links make it much easier to navigate the
            results. An example html graph profile is located at <a href="./examples/graph.html">examples/graph.html</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt>Call graphs (RubyProf::CallTreePrinter)</dt>
          <dd>Call graphs output results in the calltree profile format which is
            used by KCachegrind. Call graph support was generously donated by
            Carl Shimer. More information about the format can be found at the <a
              href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindCalltreeFormat">KCachegrind</a>
            site. </dd>
          <dt>Call stack reports (RubyProf::CallStackPrinter)</dt>
          <dd>Call stack reports produce a HTML visualization of the time spent
            in each execution path of the profiled code. An example can be found
            at <a href="http://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/tree/master/examples/stack.html">examples/stack.html</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        Another good example: <a href="http://twitpic.com/28z94a">twitpic.com/28z94a</a>
        <p>Finally, there's a so called MultiPrinter which can generate several
          reports in one profiling run. See <a href="http://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/tree/master/examples/multi.stack.html">examples/multi.stack.html</a>.
        </p>
        <p>There is also a graphviz .dot visualiser.</p>
        <p>The other option is <code>:print_file =&gt; true</code> (default
          false), which adds the filename to the output (GraphPrinter only). </p>
        <p><code>MultiPrinter</code> and <code>CallTreePrinter</code>differ
          from the other printers in that they require a directory path and a
          profile basename for the files they produce:</p>
        <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">
          <dt>RubyProf::MultiPrinter</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Uses the other printers to create several reports in one
              profiling run</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p></p>
        <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span><span
class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">MultiPrinter</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">result</span>)
<span class="ruby-identifier">printer</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">print</span>(<span
class="ruby-value">:path</span> <span class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">"."</span>, <span
class="ruby-value">:profile</span> <span class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span> <span
class="ruby-string">"profile"</span>)
</pre>
        <p>The values given in the example above are the defaults.</p>
        RubyProf::DotPrinter
        <dl class="rdoc-list note-list">
          <dd>
            <p>Creates a call graph report in GraphViz's DOT format which can be
              converted to an image</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        Use <code>RUBY_PROF_EDITOR_URI</code> environment variable to open
        source code files in your favorite text editor. For example, <code>RUBY_PROF_EDITOR_URI=atm</code>
        will produce links for Atom text editor.

        <h2><a id="performance">Performance</a></h2>
        <p>Significant effort has been put into reducing ruby-prof's overhead.
          Our tests show that the overhead associated with profiling code varies
          considerably with the code being profiled. Most programs will run
          approximately twice as slow while highly recursive programs (like the
          fibonacci series test) will run up to five times slower.</p>
        <h2><a> </a>Profiling Rails </h2>
        <p>To profile a Rails application it is vital to run it using production
          like settings (cache classes, cache view lookups, etc.). Otherwise,
          Rail's dependency loading code will overwhelm any time spent in the
          application itself (our tests show that Rails dependency loading
          causes a roughly 6x slowdown). The best way to do this is create a new
          Rails environment, profile.rb.</p>
        <p>To profile Rails:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Create a new profile.rb environment. Make sure to turn on <code>cache_classes</code>
              and <code>cache_template_loading</code>. Otherwise your profiling
              results will be overwhelmed by the time Rails spends loading
              required files. You should likely turn off caching.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add the ruby-prof to your gemfile:</p>
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">group</span> <span class="ruby-value">:profile</span> <span
class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">gem</span> <span class="ruby-string">'ruby-prof'</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre> </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add the ruby prof rack adapter to your middleware stack. One way
              to do this is by adding the following code to <code>config.ru</code>:</p>
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">if</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Rails</span>.<span
class="ruby-identifier">env</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">profile?</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">use</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Rack</span><span
class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">RubyProf</span>, <span
class="ruby-value">:path</span> <span class="ruby-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">'./tmp/profile'</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>
            <p>The path is where you want profiling results to be stored. By
              default the rack adapter will generate a html call graph report
              and flat text report.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Now make a request to your running server. New profiling
              information will be generated for each request. Note that each
              request will overwrite the profiling reports created by the
              previous request!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Version 1.0 </h2>
        <p>ruby-prof's development stretches all the way back to 2005. Fourteen
          years later, it seems time for version 1.0! Version 1.0 is a
          significant update that greatly improves the internals of ruby-prof
          and adds a number of improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Profiling is significantly faster</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The ability to measure allocations and memory usage using a
              standard (unpatched) version of ruby</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The ability to save and reload profiling results for later
              analysis</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The ability track object allocations</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the same time, it was also time to remove old code and deprecated
          methods. These changes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Drop support for old versions of ruby. Currently 2.4 and up are
              required.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove support for method elimination (instead use <a href="#method-exclusion">method
                exclusion</a>)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove the CPU_TIME measurement mode since it duplicates the
              PROCESS_TIME mode and required inline assembly code</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove the GC_TIME and GC_RUNS measurement modes since they
              required patched ruby versions. In modern ruby it is possible to
              reimplement this functionality, but it does not seem of that much
              value (shout out if you want it back).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
